## NOTES:
This folder is intended to be used to store generated data 
from simulators, RunNN and test_visualizer. Hopefully, it can
make the whole project more organized overall. 

Besides, if you don't want to walk through the whole process in sequence 
from Run.py. You may need to create folders by yourself. 

You can run the script to create all the required folders and relevant data
under corresponding folders.
